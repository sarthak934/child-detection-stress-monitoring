# Dashboard Module

This module provides a web-based dashboard to visualize detection events
generated by the vision pipeline and stored in Firebase Firestore.

The dashboard is built using Flask and serves as a read-only interface for
monitoring child detections and stress-like posture events.

---

## Responsibilities

- Fetch detection events from Firebase Firestore
- Expose detection data via REST APIs
- Render a web dashboard for visualization
- Highlight stress-like posture events for children
- Support real-time monitoring through periodic data refresh

## Setup Instructions

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Firebase Configuration
Place the Firebase service account JSON file in this folder

Update the filename in app.py to match your credentials file

Run the Dashboard
python app.py
The dashboard will be available at:

http://localhost:5000
Available Endpoints
/
Renders the dashboard UI

/api/latest
Returns the most recent detection events from Firebase in JSON format

Notes
The dashboard does not perform any detection or ML inference

All detection logic exists in the vision pipeline

Firebase acts as the single source of truth for historical data

Stress detection refers to posture-based events, not psychological diagnosis

Intended Usage
Real-time monitoring of child detections

Visual inspection of stress-like posture events

Debugging and validation of the detection pipeline

Demonstration and reporting purposes
